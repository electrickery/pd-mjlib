Mjlib is a small library created by Mark Williamson. 

This git-fork of the Pure-data library mjlib is cloned from https://git.puredata.info/cgit/svn2git/libraries/mjlib.git, which is the svn-to-git from https://sourceforge.net/p/pure-data/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/externals/mjlib/.

The objects in the library are:

<dl>
<dt>about</dt>       <dd>random generator based on anchor value and percentual deviation</dd>
<dt>metroplus</dt>   <dd>metro based in list of intervals</dd>
<dt>monorhythm</dt>  <dd>rythm generator outputs beat, accent and sync bangs</dd>
<dt>morse</dt>       <dd>converts ASCII to dot and dash bangs</dd>
<dt>n2m</dt>         <dd>note name to midi convertor</dd>
<dt>pin~</dt>        <dd>paramerterized random signal router</dd>
<dt>prob</dt>        <dd>random generator governed by time interval and probability</dd>
